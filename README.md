# Constellation Diagram and The Geometric Representation of Digital Signals

This project is from a tutorial that demonstrates how digital and wireless communication systems work using MATLAB. It begins with an overview of the general system architecture, then it illustrate the transmitter section, covering key processes such as modulation, pulse shaping, and upconversion. The signal is then saved as a sound file, transmitted wirelessly, and recorded again in MATLAB for receiver processing. Finally, it demonstrate the receiver-side operations, including downconversion, matched filtering, synchronization, and channel estimation.

The main goal is to provide an intuitive understanding of these systems using simple and primitive processing techniques. Although we do not explore complex algorithms, the fundamental principles remain the same across all communication systems. I hope this video inspires you and interest in the subject and encourages further study.

## Running The Code
The following Code is to simuate the BER: **`BER_simulation.m`**

The following Code is to simuate the statistical properties of the received signal at the receiver: **`statistical_simulation.m`**

The other healper function that was used: **`plot_const.m`**
